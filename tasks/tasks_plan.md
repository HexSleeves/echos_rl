## Technical Architecture Delivered

### Simplified Turn System

```rust
// Clean, simple turn processing
while let Some((entity, time)) = turn_queue.get_next_actor() {
    if is_player && !has_action {
        next_state.set(GameState::GatherActions);
        return;
    }

    if let Some(action) = actor.next_action() {
        match action.perform(world) {
            Ok(time_spent) => turn_queue.schedule_turn(entity, time + time_spent),
            Err(_) => turn_queue.schedule_turn(entity, time + 100),
        }
    }
}
```

### Big-Brain Integration

```rust
// System scheduling in PreUpdate for optimal performance
app.add_systems(
    PreUpdate,
    (
        chase_player_scorer_system,
        flee_from_player_scorer_system,
        wander_scorer_system,
        player_visibility_scorer_system,
    ).in_set(BigBrainSet::Scorers)
);

app.add_systems(
    PreUpdate,
    (
        chase_player_action_system,
        flee_from_player_action_system,
        wander_action_system,
        idle_action_system,
    ).in_set(BigBrainSet::Actions)
);
```

### AI Behavior Configuration

- **Hostile**: Threshold 0.6, prioritizes chasing over wandering
- **Passive**: Threshold 0.5, prioritizes fleeing over wandering
- **Neutral**: Threshold 0.3, primarily wanders with minimal other behaviors

### FOV-Based Detection

- Leverages existing FOV system for line-of-sight detection
- Configurable detection ranges (3-6 tiles based on enemy type)
- Last known position tracking for persistent chase behavior
