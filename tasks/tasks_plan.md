#### What Was Delivered

1. **Big-Brain Utility AI Integration**

   - Added big-brain dependency and plugin integration
   - Set up proper system scheduling in PreUpdate
   - Created scorer and action system architecture

2. **AI Behavior System**

   - Three distinct AI behavior types: Hostile, Passive, Neutral
   - FOV-based player detection with configurable ranges
   - Pathfinding with obstacle avoidance
   - Integration with existing turn-based system

3. **Enemy Entity Definitions**

   - Hostile Guard: Chases player aggressively
   - Passive Critter: Flees when threatened
   - Neutral Wanderer: Ambient movement, ignores player

4. **AI Action Systems**

   - Chase behavior with pathfinding
   - Flee behavior with escape routes
   - Wander behavior for ambient life
   - Idle fallback behavior

5. **Data-Driven Spawning**
   - Automatic behavior detection from entity names
   - Integration with existing entity definition system
   - Configurable detection ranges and speeds

## Technical Architecture Delivered

### Big-Brain Integration

```rust
// System scheduling in PreUpdate for optimal performance
app.add_systems(
    PreUpdate,
    (
        chase_player_scorer_system,
        flee_from_player_scorer_system,
        wander_scorer_system,
        player_visibility_scorer_system,
    ).in_set(BigBrainSet::Scorers)
);

app.add_systems(
    PreUpdate,
    (
        chase_player_action_system,
        flee_from_player_action_system,
        wander_action_system,
        idle_action_system,
    ).in_set(BigBrainSet::Actions)
);
```

### AI Behavior Configuration

- **Hostile**: Threshold 0.6, prioritizes chasing over wandering
- **Passive**: Threshold 0.5, prioritizes fleeing over wandering
- **Neutral**: Threshold 0.3, primarily wanders with minimal other behaviors

### FOV-Based Detection

- Leverages existing FOV system for line-of-sight detection
- Configurable detection ranges (3-6 tiles based on enemy type)
- Last known position tracking for persistent chase behavior

- ✅ `src/controller/systems/process.rs` - Updated monster turn processing
- ✅ `Cargo.toml` - Added big-brain and regex dependencies

## Quality Metrics Achieved

### Functionality

- ✅ Enemies spawn with distinct behaviors
- ✅ Player detection works via FOV system
- ✅ Pathfinding avoids obstacles and other entities
- ✅ Turn-based integration maintains game flow
- ✅ Data-driven configuration allows easy enemy creation

### Code Quality

- ✅ Build compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Clean integration with existing systems
- ✅ Modular, extensible architecture

### Performance

- ✅ Big-brain systems run in PreUpdate for optimal performance
- ✅ Scorer systems are highly parallelizable
- ✅ No performance regressions observed
- ✅ Efficient pathfinding algorithms

## Player Experience Delivered

### Enemy Behaviors

1. **Hostile Guards** (Speed: 110)

   - Detect player within 6 tiles
   - Chase aggressively with pathfinding
   - Create tension and challenge

2. **Passive Critters** (Speed: 90)

   - Detect threats within 5 tiles
   - Flee when player approaches
   - Add variety and life to the world

3. **Neutral Wanderers** (Speed: 80)
   - Limited 3-tile detection range
   - Wander aimlessly, ignore player
   - Provide ambient movement

### Gameplay Features

- ✅ FOV-based stealth mechanics (enemies only detect what they can see)
- ✅ Tactical positioning (use obstacles to break line of sight)
- ✅ Varied enemy encounters (different behaviors create different challenges)
- ✅ Turn-based strategy (AI actions integrate with player turns)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Immediate Extensions

1. **Combat System**: Add attack actions for hostile enemies
2. **Alert States**: Visual/audio feedback when enemies spot player
3. **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust AI parameters by game level

### Advanced Features

1. **Group Coordination**: Multi-enemy tactical behaviors
2. **Memory System**: Longer-term player position tracking
3. **Patrol Routes**: Predefined movement patterns
4. **Dynamic Spawning**: Context-aware enemy placement
