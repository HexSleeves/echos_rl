# Product Requirements Document: Data-Driven Entity System

## Project Overview
**Echos in the Dark** is a Bevy-based roguelike game that needs to transition from hardcoded entity spawning to a flexible, data-driven system using RON (Rust Object Notation) files.

## Problem Statement
Currently, entity spawning is hardcoded in `src/model/systems/spawner.rs`:
- Player spawning is fixed with hardcoded components (position, stats, sprite coords)
- Enemy spawning is limited and inflexible
- No easy way to create new entity types without code changes
- Difficult to balance or modify entity properties
- No support for procedural or designer-driven entity variations

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **RON-Based Entity Definitions**
   - Define player and entity templates in RON files
   - Support component composition through data files
   - Enable runtime loading and modification of entity types

2. **Flexible Spawning System**
   - Replace hardcoded spawning with data-driven approach
   - Support multiple entity types (player, enemies, NPCs, items)
   - Enable spawn variations and randomization
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing systems

3. **Component System Integration**
   - Work seamlessly with existing Bevy ECS components
   - Support all current components (Position, TurnActor, ViewShed, TileSprite, etc.)
   - Enable easy addition of new component types

### Technical Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Minimal runtime overhead compared to hardcoded approach
   - Efficient asset loading and caching
   - Support for hot-reloading during development

2. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation between data and logic
   - Type-safe deserialization
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new component types
   - Support for entity inheritance/templates
   - Plugin architecture for custom components

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Player can be spawned from RON definition
- [ ] Multiple enemy types can be defined in data files
- [ ] Existing gameplay remains unchanged
- [ ] New entity types can be added without code changes
- [ ] Performance is equivalent to hardcoded system
- [ ] Development workflow is improved with hot-reloading

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Player entity definition migration
- Basic enemy entity definitions
- Core component support (Position, TurnActor, ViewShed, TileSprite, etc.)
- Asset loading system integration
- Basic entity template system

**Out of Scope:**
- Complex entity behavior scripting
- Advanced inheritance hierarchies
- Runtime entity editor
- Multiplayer considerations

## Stakeholders
- **Developers**: Easier entity creation and modification
- **Game Designers**: Direct control over entity properties
- **Players**: More varied and interesting entities

## Constraints
- Must work within existing Bevy ECS architecture
- Must maintain current game performance
- Should leverage existing asset loading system
- Must preserve existing save/load compatibility
